# Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **sentiment of user reviews** collected from social media or online platforms. The goal is to classify each review as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
In today's digital world, customers express their opinions and experiences online. Analyzing these reviews manually is time-consuming and inefficient. This project automates the process of understanding **customer sentiment**, which helps companies:
- Improve services
- Understand user satisfaction
- Take data-driven decisions

## Dataset
The dataset used contains text reviews with associated sentiment labels.  
It includes:
- Customer review texts
- Labels: Positive, Negative, Neutral

(Data may be collected from social media, review platforms, or CSV datasets.)

## Techniques and Tools Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:  
  - Tokenization  
  - Stopword Removal  
  - Lemmatization  
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Flask Web App (optional, if included)

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Remove noise, special characters, stopwords
   - Lemmatize words to base form
2. **Text Vectorization**
   - Transform textual data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
3. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple classification models to detect sentiment
4. **Evaluation**
   - Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Visualize results with confusion matrix and charts
5. **Prediction**
   - Predict sentiment from custom user input

## Results & Visualizations
- Achieved high accuracy using [Best Performing Model]
- Visualizations included:
  - Sentiment Distribution (Pie/Bar chart)
  - Confusion Matrix
  - WordCloud of most frequent words

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Swetha-Salkineni/Sentimental-Analysis
   cd Sentimental-Analysis
## Run the notebook or script:
Google Collab

## Model Performance
Model evaluation includes:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ROC Curve (optional)
